# FOREIGN ARTIFACT DOCTRINE
## Principle: Quarantine, don't adopt

### CORE INSIGHT
External artifacts are FROZEN EXPERIENCES, not intelligence.
They contain:
- Someone else's assumptions
- Unverified constraints  
- Silent biases
- Conceptual contamination

### RULES
1. **All external artifacts go to quarantine/**
2. **Nothing in quarantine/ is imported or trusted**
3. **Graduation requires active re-derivation**
4. **If it can't be re-derived, it can't graduate**

### MENTAL MODEL
- Data: ORE, not metal
- Models: Suspected intelligence
- Configs: Foreign constraints
- Code: Frozen thought patterns

### VERIFICATION REQUIRED
1. Constitutional alignment check
2. Re-training under your constraints
3. First principles validation
4. Zero-drift possibility proof

### WHEN IN DOUBT
Ask: "Did RezStack derive this, or just inherit it?"

### QUOTABLE
"Your intuition is correct — external artifacts must be treated as suspect by default."
"Population for inspection, not for authority."
"Ownership of understanding cannot be imported."
